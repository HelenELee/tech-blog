  ## Description
  This is a Tech Blog application where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It is a full stack application with the front end developed using Handlebars, routing done using Express.js and Node.js and the backend uses Sequelize to interact with MySQL where the data is stored.

  Users can create an account and login and their session details are stored utilising the "express-session" package. Returning users will be authenticated against their username and password. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt.

  The application follows the Model View Controller pattern. The Controller contains routes for the API and routes to render the content using Handlebars. The Views holds the Handlebar files for rendering and The Model being an abstraction that represents the table in the mysql database holds the files that define the data.

  Logged in users can create, read, update and delete Blog posts, as well as comment on existing Blog posts. User are automatically logged out after a set time.
  
  The application is developed using the following technologies:
  - Javascript
  - Node.js
  - Sequelize
  - MySQL2
  - Express.js
  - Dotenv package
  - Handlebars

  The main challenge in developing this application was getting all the routes developed correctly and in the correct file structure using the MVC pattern.
